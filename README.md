# Simple Links Box

Created this small project to have a private storage for links with a clean and simple GUI. Storage is done with
simple JSON files so that is doesn't need a database.

Bootstrap and jQuery is included so you simply can download and upload to your host.

## Requirements
A webhost that supports PHP 5 and to be able to upload the files with FTP. Also it is a good idea that the webhost supports
Basic authentication.

## Installation
1. Download
2. Upload to your webhost
3. Open in a browser
4. Add links
 
;) Not more than that.

## Private storage
I would suggest that you add Basic authentication with your webhosts control panel for the directory you have uploaded
the project into. This will add a basic login.
